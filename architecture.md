## üóÇÔ∏è System Flow & Model Relationships

### 1. User & Authentication

- `User` is for authentication and admin/HR access (not regular employees).
- Employees are managed in the `Employee` model.

### 2. Departments

- Each `Department` can have a manager (`Employee`) and many employees.
- Employees reference their department via `departmentId`.

### 3. Employees

- Central entity for all HR data.
- Linked to: `Department`, `Attendance`, `LeaveRequest`, `Payroll`, `PerformanceReview`, `Notification`.
- Can have a QR secret for QR-based check-in/out.

### 4. Attendance

- Each record links to an `Employee`.
- Tracks daily check-in/out, status, QR data, overtime, and approval.
- Status is controlled by the `AttendanceStatus` enum.

### 5. Leave Requests

- Each request links to an `Employee` and optionally an approver.
- Leave type is controlled by the `LeaveType` enum (expand as needed).
- Tracks status, dates, reason, comments, and attachments.

### 6. Payroll

- Each payroll record links to an `Employee`.
- Tracks salary, bonuses, deductions, taxes, net pay, and payment status.

### 7. Performance Reviews

- Each review links to an `Employee` and a reviewer (also an employee).
- Tracks review period, score, rating, and comments.

### 8. Notifications

- Each notification links to an `Employee` (user).
- Type can be controlled by `NotificationType` (expand as needed).
- Used for system alerts (e.g., leave request updates, review reminders).

## üèóÔ∏è Development Flow

1. **Authentication**

   - Use the `User` model for admin/HR logins.
   - Employees are managed separately (not for login unless you extend the model).

2. **Employee Management**

   - CRUD operations on `Employee`.
   - Assign to `Department`.
   - Set employment details, status, and QR secret.

3. **Attendance Tracking**

   - Employees check in/out (optionally via QR).
   - Create `Attendance` records with status, times, and notes.
   - Approvers can update/approve attendance if needed.

4. **Leave Management**

   - Employees submit `LeaveRequest` with type, dates, and reason.
   - Approvers (managers/HR) update status and add comments.
   - Attachments (e.g., medical notes) can be uploaded.

5. **Payroll**

   - HR/admin creates payroll records for each employee per period.
   - Calculate net pay from salary, bonuses, deductions, and taxes.
   - Update status as processed/paid.

6. **Performance Reviews**

   - Managers/HR create reviews for employees.
   - Track period, score, rating, and comments.
   - Status tracks if review is in progress or completed.

7. **Notifications**
   - System generates notifications for employees (e.g., leave status, review reminders).
   - Employees can mark notifications as read.

## üß© Integration Tips

- **Frontend:**

  - Use the enums in your API responses for dropdowns and status displays.
  - Always use IDs for relations (e.g., `employeeId`, `departmentId`).
  - For QR check-in/out, use the `qrSecret` and `qrCheckIn`/`qrCheckOut` fields.

- **Backend:**

  - Use Prisma‚Äôs relations for efficient querying (e.g., `include: { department: true }`).
  - Validate enum values on create/update.
  - Use default values for dates and statuses.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Add more leave types, notification types, or statuses as your business logic grows.
  - Add more fields to `User` if you want employees to log in.

## ‚úÖ Ready for Development

- This schema is normalized, scalable, and matches the frontend‚Äôs needs.
- You can now run:
  ```sh
  npx prisma migrate dev
  npx prisma generate
  ```
- Start building your API endpoints and connect your frontend!
